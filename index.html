    <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Jeroen</h1>
    <p>My path into the world of software development has been somewhat unorthodox, yet incredibly rewarding. The last decade I spent as a professional <span>Chef, aspiring farmer, and community activist</span>. I consider myself a problem solver, critical thinker, hard worker, and determined to see things through to the end. The underbelly of the food industry is not for the faint of heart -- it can be hectic, even toxic at times. But moving up through the ranks to eventually become sous chef of an <em>incredibly</em> successful Thai restaurant has provided me with a thick skin, an acute sense of urgency, and a conscientious style of leadership. It has taught me that <span>talent and skill emerge from all facets, and all walks of life</span>. I will carry these values with me into my future in software -- to hopefully make a lasting, positive impact on my team, my cohort, and my community.</p>
